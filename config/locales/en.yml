    title: "What is Loot Crate&trade;?"
    content: "Loot Crate&trade; was founded in 2012 by an entrepreneurial team of geeks and gamers who thought that online retail was missing the sense of community, interactivity, and mystery we fell in love with at shows like PAX and Comic-Con. Each month, Loot Crate&trade; ships a themed mystery box of the best geek, gaming, and pop culture gear to a subscriber base of over 100,000 Looters. We emphasize phenomenal support and content, and include gear from some of the most respected entertainment and consumer product companies in the world."
    subcontent: "Join us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, and Youtube to stay in touch and connect with our awesome community. Happy Looting!"

      <p>To enter the Sweepstakes as a Loot Crate&trade; subscriber, no action is necessary as long as the account is currently paid and active. If there is a dispute as to the identity of an entrant who made a potentially winning entry, Sponsor will deem that the entry was made by the authorized account holder of the email address. The \"authorized account holder\" is defined as the natural person to whom the email address is assigned by an internet service provider, online service provider or other organization (e.g., business, educational institution, etc.) that is responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address. </p>

      <b>WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION. </b>

Odds of winning depend upon the total number of eligible entries received.
